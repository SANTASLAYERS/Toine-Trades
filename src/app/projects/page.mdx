# Algorithmic Trading System

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive algorithmic trading system designed to identify and exploit market inefficiencies in futures markets. The system combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and robust risk management to generate consistent returns while minimizing drawdowns.

The trading algorithm currently focuses on the micro e-mini futures markets (MNQ, MES, etc.) with a medium-frequency trading approach, executing approximately 5-15 trades per day.

## System Components

### 1. Data Pipeline

- **Market Data Feeds**: Direct connections to market data providers offering low-latency price feeds.
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom technical indicators and statistical features derived from raw market data.
- **Normalization Engine**: Real-time normalization of features to ensure consistent model inputs regardless of market conditions.

### 2. Model Stack

- **Primary Alpha Model**: Ensemble of gradient-boosted decision trees and neural networks for price movement prediction.
- **Regime Detection**: Hidden Markov Models to identify different market regimes and adjust strategy parameters.
- **Entry/Exit Optimization**: Reinforcement learning models to optimize trade timing and execution.

### 3. Risk Management

- **Position Sizing**: Dynamic position sizing based on market volatility and model confidence.
- **Stop Loss System**: Adaptive stop-loss mechanisms with volatility-based adjustments.
- **Drawdown Controls**: Automatic trading reduction during underperformance periods.
- **Correlation Engine**: Monitors correlation between strategies to maintain portfolio diversity.

### 4. Execution Layer

- **Order Management**: Custom order management system interfacing with NinjaTrader.
- **Execution Algorithms**: Smart order routing and execution to minimize slippage.
- **Latency Optimization**: Advanced techniques to minimize execution delays.

### 5. Performance Analytics

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of strategy performance and risk metrics.
- **Post-trade Analysis**: Detailed analysis of executed trades to identify improvement opportunities.
- **Reporting Engine**: Automated generation of performance reports and visualizations.

## Development Process

The system follows a rigorous development and deployment process:
