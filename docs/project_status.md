## How to Run the Project

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   cd /home/pangasa/personal_website/temp_project
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000

2. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run Data Converter**
   Once you have a NinjaTrader CSV export file:
   ```bash
   python scripts/nt2json.py path/to/nt_export.csv src/data/perf.json
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Focus on replacing placeholder content with real data and images
2. Test the Python converter with actual NinjaTrader exports
3. Run quality checks (responsiveness, Lighthouse audit)
4. Deploy to Vercel when ready

## Recent Fixes

1. ✅ Added `"use client"` directive to the Performance page to fix client-side rendering issues
2. ✅ Updated Next.js configuration for proper MDX support:
   - Created `next.config.js` (replaced TypeScript version) with CommonJS syntax
   - Set up the withMDX wrapper with correct provider
   - Set page extensions to include `.mdx` files
3. ✅ These changes ensure that:
   - React hooks like `useState` work properly on client components
   - MDX content renders correctly throughout the application
   - Build process completes without Node.js compatibility errors

The foundation of the project is complete and ready for personalization with real content and deployment to production. All critical build issues have been resolved.
